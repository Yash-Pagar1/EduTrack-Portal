Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)


Frontend / Client: Java-based client application



Project Overview
The EduTrack Portal is a full-stack Java-based web + client application designed to manage and streamline academic activities.
The portal provides CRUD operations for managing batches along with detailed student records within each batch.
It leverages Spring Boot for building a RESTful backend, MongoDB for scalable data storage, and a Java client application for user interaction.
The system simplifies batch creation, student management, and record updates, making it a centralized classroom management solution.

Key Features
Batch Management
Create, update, delete, and view batches.


Store batch details such as batch name, schedule, duration, and trainer information.


Student Records
Maintain student details (name, contact, enrollment date, assigned batch).


Link students dynamically with their respective batch.


CRUD Operations
REST APIs for Create, Read, Update, Delete functionalities (Spring Boot).


Database Integration
Uses MongoDB for flexible and scalable data storage.


Client-Side Application
Java-based client with a user-friendly menu to interact with backend APIs.


Scalable & Modular Design
Built on Spring Boot architecture, allowing easy integration with future features (attendance, performance tracking, fee management).



Learning Outcomes
Hands-on experience with the Spring Boot framework for backend development.


Practical understanding of MongoDB and NoSQL data modeling.


Exposure to REST API design and client-server architecture.


Strong application of full-stack Java development.


Experience in modular project design suitable for real-world systems.
